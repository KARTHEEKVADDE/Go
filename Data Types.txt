Data Types

So, to get us started, it’s important to know that there are 4 distinct categories of types within the Go programming language:

Basic Types - what we’ll be covering in this tutorial
Aggregate Types - These are arrays and structs
Reference Types - These are your pointers and slices
Interface Types - These are your standard interfaces
